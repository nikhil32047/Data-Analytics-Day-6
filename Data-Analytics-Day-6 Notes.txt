Data Analytics Essentials — Intermediate Level:
===============================================

📘 Lesson 1: Correlation vs Causation:
======================================
🔍 Summary:
Correlation means two variables move together

Causation means one variable causes the other

Correlation ≠ Causation ⚠️

🧠 Real-World Example:
At YouTube, if video views increase and ad revenue increases, that’s correlation.
But just uploading more videos won’t always cause higher revenue — quality matters!


📘 Lesson 2: Outlier Detection:
===============================
🔍 Summary:
Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest. They can:

Skew analysis

Reveal errors or interesting trends

Methods:

Z-score

IQR (Interquartile Range)

🧠 Real-World Example:
In Flipkart transaction data, a ₹99,999 order might be a fraudulent spike — that’s an outlier worth investigating.


📘 Lesson 3: Central Tendency – Mean vs Median:
===============================================
🔍 Summary:
Mean: arithmetic average

Median: middle value
Use median when data is skewed by outliers.

🧠 Real-World Example:
In a company, if most employees earn ₹30K but the CEO earns ₹10L,

Mean salary is misleading

Median salary better represents majority


📘 Lesson 4: Introduction to A/B Testing:
=========================================
🔍 Summary:
A/B Testing is used to compare two versions of a product or webpage to see which performs better.

🧠 Real-World Example:
At Zomato, run A/B tests to:

Compare red vs green “Order Now” buttons

Measure clicks & conversions


📘 Lesson 5: Real-Time vs Batch Data Processing:
================================================
🔍 Summary:
Real-Time: data is processed instantly (live)

Batch: data is collected, stored, and processed in chunks

🧠 Real-World Example:
Netflix uses real-time data to recommend shows

Banks use batch processing to settle daily transactions
